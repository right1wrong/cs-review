chap 1.1
The key point that most beginners couldn't get when learning this chapter is that computer science is actually a set of knowledge which includes
how to represent things in our world and try to find solutions ruled by modern computer architecture. So I suggest to know the history of how computers were
created and developed first, which can be learned through crashcourse on Youtube.

Based on this core takeaway, we can easily find that our thinking patterns can be trained into an automatic simulated computer because we get the ability to
imitate how computers work and how to build new algos or models or systems to fix problems in real life by utilizing current computation power. But isn't it
similar to us being colonized by computers' mind?
