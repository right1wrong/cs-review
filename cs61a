chap 1.1
The key point that most beginners couldn't get when learning this chapter is that computer science is actually a set of knowledge which includes
how to represent things in our world and try to find solutions ruled by modern computer architecture. So I suggest to know the history of how computers were
created and developed first, which can be learned through crashcourse on Youtube.
